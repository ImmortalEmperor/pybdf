 
pybdf is a pure python library to read BIOSEMI 24-bit BDF files.
While being slower than alternative C-based libraries like
BioSig <http://biosig.sourceforge.net/>, it is very easy to install
and use.

Release builds are available on pypi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pybdf/>

The documentation is available here <http://pythonhosted.org/pybdf/>
